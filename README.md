# INTRODUCTION
1.1	Overview:
UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (UMS) is a  product which covers all aspects of Universities. UMS covers every minute aspects of a universities work flow and integrates all processes with user friendly interface. UMS is an outcome of hard work done by us in supervision of several teacher. UMS streamline path of information flow in organization by taking care of following departments:
•	DepartmentFee
•	Examination Department
•	Attendance
•	Faculty information portal
•	Student information portal

1.2	Purpose:
•	Drive operational efficiency.
•	Self-service systems with simple to use with little or no training.
•	Elimination of duplicate data entry processes.
•	Monitoring and decision support system.
•	Automation of all the Academic / Examination / Administration operations.
•	Ease and accuracy of reporting.

1.3	Scope:
This project deals with the various functioning in University management process. The main idea is to implement a proper process to system. In our existing system contains a many operations registration, student search, fees, attendance, exam records, performance of the student etc. All these activity takeout manually by administrator.


# Software Requirements :

Operating system	: Windows 10
Application server	: JAVA (NetBeans)
Front end	: JAVA
Connectivity	: JDBC Driver
Database connectivity	: WAMP (MYSQL Console) 


# TOOL DESCRIPTION
# Overview of Front End

An important issue for the development of a project is the selection of suitable front- end and back-end. Front-end selection:
1.	It must have a graphical user interface that assists employees that are not from IT background.
2.	Scalability and extensibility.
3.	Flexibility.
4.	Robustness.
5.	Must provide excellent reporting features with good printing support.
6.	Platform independent.
7.	Easy to debug and maintain.
8.	Front end must support some popular back end like MySQL.



# About Java:
Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc. 
Here are some important Java applications:

•	It is used for developing Android Apps
•	Helps you to create Enterprise Software
•	Wide range of Mobile java Applications
•	Scientific Computing Applications
•	Use for Big Data Analytics
•	Java Programming of Hardware devices
•	Used for Server-Side Technologies like Apache, JBoss, GlassFish, etc.


# Overview of Back End
# Back End Selection:
1.	Multiple user support.
2.	Efficient data handling.
3.	Provide inherent features for security.
4.	Efficient data retrieval and maintenance.
5.	Stored procedures.
6.	Popularity.
7.	Operating System compatible.
8.	Easy to install.
9.	Various drivers must be available.
10.	Easy to implant with the Front-end.
According to above stated features we selected MySQL as the backend.
The technical feasibility is frequently the most difficult area encountered at this stage. It is essential that the process of analysis and definition be conducted in parallel with an assessment to technical feasibility. It centers on the existing computer system (hardware, software etc.) and to what extent it can support the proposed system.


# About SQL:

SQL is Structured Query Language, which is a computer language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data stored in a relational database. 
SQL is the standard language for Relational Database System. All the Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.
MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small and big businesses. MySQL is developed, marketed and supported by MySQL AB, which is a Swedish company. MySQL is becoming so popular because of many good reasons.[1]
MySQL is released under an open-source license. So you have nothing to pay to use it. MySQL is a very powerful program in its own right. It handles a large subset of the functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages. MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language. MySQL works on many operating systems and with many languages including PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc.
MySQL works very quickly and works well even with large data sets. MySQL is very friendly to PHP, the most appreciated language for web development. MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table. The default file size limit for a table is 4GB, but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle it) to a theoretical limit of 8 million terabytes (TB).
Also, they are using different dialects, such as −

•	Oracle using PL/SQL,.
•	SQL is widely popular because it offers the following advantages −
•	Allows users to access data in the database management systems.
•	Allows users to describe the data.relational
•	Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.
•	Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.
•	Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.
•	Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.
•	Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.
